Some Interesting Facts on the English Premier League (EPL) 2020/2021 Season 

### Project Details
To analyse the EPL 2020/2021 Season Data and come up with some interesting insights. The project will be mainly using the pandas and matplotlib python libraries to carry out the analysis and visualization of the dataset.

### Data Source
[EPL 2020/2021 Season Data from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajatrc1705/english-premier-league202021)
<br /> [EPL 2020/2021 League Points Table from the Premier League Website](https://www.premierleague.com/tables?co=1&se=363&ha=-1)

### Input Features of Dataset
The main dataset used contains the 2020/2021 English Premier League season data on every soccer player in the league.
It covers their league profile which consists of attributes such as their Age, Nationality and position. The data set also covers their performance statistics such as each playerâ€™s goals scored, and assists recorded.

The second data set that was used essentially contains the English Premier League points table.

## Findings 
The project centred around looking into three areas which were thought to be interesting to look at:
1) Age Profile
2) Nationality Profile
3) Fouls vs Advantage Obtained From Fouling

Running the describe() function on the age data frame, the descriptive statistics of the normal distribution is obtained as shown in the above picture. As can be seen, the standard deviation of the normal distribution curve is approximately 4. The Empirical rule in statistics that 68% of the population falls within one standard deviation from the mean. As such, it can be seen that most of the players are aged between 20-30 years old.
